# Green Stock-analysis

## Overview of Project: 

The purpose of this analysis is to offer a clear and simple way for our friend Steve to quickly analyse stock data for different years and to do it in as efficient a manner as possible. In this case when we refactored the code we removed the nested for loop.

## Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.



## Summary: 

### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
